        <p>
            A punitive thrash metal project influenced by hardcore punk, west coast hard rock, and proto-death metal bands of the 
            '80s such as , , and , Toxic Holocaust is largely a one-man operation run by Oregon native . Emerging in the late '90s, 
            the project eventually expanded into a live entity, and by 2020 the group had issued six well-received full-length albums and multiple EPs.
            founded the band in 1999 in the city of Portland. Writing and recording all of the group's music himself, he issued a 
            pair of demos (1999's Radiation Sickness and 2002's Critical Mass) before unleashing the project's first full-length 
            effort, Evil Never Dies, in 2003. The group's burgeoning popularity in the metal underground prompted  to take the 
            enterprise out of the studio and onto the stage, so he hired a backing band and hit the road. However, the expanded 
            version of Toxic Holocaust would not make its way into the studio for album number two. 2005's Hell on Earth once again 
            saw  assume all duties, but he did manage to enlist renowned heavy metal artist Ed Repka (, , etc.) to design the cover. 
            Extensive touring followed, along with a recording contract with America's premier death metal label, . In addition to 
            releasing the third Toxic Holocaust album, An Overdose of Death... (2008),  reissued Evil Never Dies and Hell on Earth. 
            The Gravelord EP arrived in 2009, followed in 2011 by the full-length Conjure and Command, which was the first Toxic 
            Holocaust release to feature a full band, with  joined by bass player Phil Zeller and drummer Nick Bellmore. That same 
            crew stayed aboard for 2013's Chemistry of Consciousness, but  would return to the one-man-band setup for 2019's 
            dystopian technological takeover-themed Primal Future: 2019.
